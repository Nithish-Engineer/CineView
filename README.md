# CineView

CineView is a React application built to enhance my skills in TypeScript, Context API, and state management using `useReducer`. This project serves as a practical implementation to deepen my understanding of modern React features and practices.

## Key Features

1. **Centralized State Management**: 
   - Utilizes `useReducer` and `useContext` to manage state centrally, reducing the complexity that arises from prop drilling and multiple `useState` hooks.

2. **Minimized useState Usage**:
   - Emphasizes the use of fewer `useState` hooks, demonstrating best practices for maintaining and managing component state effectively.

3. **Styled-Components**:
   - Implements styled-components for styling, allowing for CSS-in-JS syntax. This approach promotes modularity and encapsulation of styles, making the application more maintainable and scalable.

4. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - Incorporates TypeScript throughout the application to leverage type safety, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors. This experience aids in understanding TypeScript's benefits in a React ecosystem.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensures that the application is mobile-friendly and responsive, providing a seamless user experience across various devices.

6. **Search Functionality**:
   - Includes a search bar that filters through a list of movies, showcasing practical use of state and event handling in React.

7. **Movie Listings**:
   - Displays a comprehensive list of movies, utilizing components for each movie card, demonstrating component composition and reusability.

8. **Learning Outcomes**:
   - This project serves as a significant learning milestone, covering essential React concepts and TypeScript application. The hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of modern web development practices.
